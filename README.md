## My process

- I started by breaking the challenge into two parts. First i had to divide the image from the text.
  Since they were both going to be in a card, it was relatively easy to understand what needed to be done.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Position

### Continued development

I would really like to get better and comfortable with moving things around with CSS properties. Seeing as i somewhat did a lousy job with my 'position' properties.
